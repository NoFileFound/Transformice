# How I can download a langue from the game?
- To download a langue (language) from the game you go to at : http://transformice.com/langues/tfm-langue_code.gz (new variant) or http://transformice.com/langues/tfz_language_code (old variant)

# What is the difference between new variant and other variant of the game language?
- The new variant appears to be after the game version: 1.614. The old is before that version.

# How I can find the languages for old game version?
- Download them from here: https://github.com/paranormalactivity22/SWF-Database-and-Tools/tree/main/Tools/Languages

# Is there a raw version of the game languages?
- Yes but it is only for the old variant: you can download it here -> http://transformice.com/langues/tfm_language_code

# Is it possible to modify the game language? (Old variant)
- Yes it is possible you need to first understand how TFZ is working and its ZLIB compression. That's right, just make your own zlib decompressor or download this from here: https://github.com/paranormalactivity22/SWF-Database-and-Tools/blob/main/Tools/SWF%20Tools/Executable%20Tools/TFZ%20Decompress.7z

# Is it possible to modify the game language? (New variant)
- Yes it is possible, it's the same as old variant.

# How i can add a new title?
- You need to decompress the game language then go to at last 造 character and then make T_xxx, where xxx is the title number you want to have. and then add the title meaning for example:
T_123=I am batman造

and don't forget the 造 at the end. this is a seperator between every translation string.

# Is it possible to modify already exist translation string?
- Yeah locate the string and replace the content into it.

# Is it possible to remove a translation string?
- Yeah just remove it, don't be surprised you will see nothing.

# How i can make a colored title?
T_123=<font color='#hex_color'>I am batman</font>造

# Some of the translation strings are not in transformice.com, where are they?
- They are in https://data.atelier801.com/trad/
